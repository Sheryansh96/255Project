Project Title: - Disease Susceptibility
Dataset: - 
The Dataset has been taken from CDC, The link to access the dataset is given below.
https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2021/files/LLCP2021XPT.zip

About Dataset: -

1)This dataset contains standard state-specific data on health risk behaviours, chronic illnesses and conditions, access to health care, and use of preventive health services for the main causes of death and disability in the United States. 

2)The data is collected using landline telephone-based and cellular telephone-based surveys.

3)This dataset contains 441,456 records and 330 columns.

Purpose of the project: -
	
	The goal is to anticipate an individual's health condition based on socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics. For example, given the individual's blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking habits, and so on, the model will predict whether or not the individual is at risk of having a heart attack.	

Proposed Methodology and Techniques Used: -

1)Data Cleaning and Manipulation.

2)Selection of features based on the disease to be predicted.

3)Train the data to classify whether the individual is at risk or not.

4)Algorithms used to classify: - Random Forest, Logistic Regression.

5)Obtain and visualize the results.


# Installations:-

1) Python : 3.7.13
2) Numpy
3) Pandas
4) sklearn
5) py-xgboost

# Running :- 

To run either the cancer, diabetes or Heart Attack problem, install the packages mentioned in the Installations section. Once done navigate to one of the notebooks and run them using Jupyter notebook.

We have updataed a test_data.csv which can be used to validate the notebooks for the predictions.
